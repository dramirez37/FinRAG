This table allows quantifying whether explosive episodes in a given sector are significantly associated with explosive episodes in the remaining sectors. Overall, the results reveal that periods of explosive dynamics in any Chinese equity sector are contemporaneously related to explosive periods in many other sectors, suggesting the presence of co-explosive behavior.",
